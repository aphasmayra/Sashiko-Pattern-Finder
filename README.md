# Sashiko-Pattern-Finder-App
This is my first project using JavaScript.

You can try out the version adapted to run on Ghost here: https://www.stitchesontherun.com/which-pattern-is-the-perfect-match-for-you/

## What does this app do?
You are given 4x2 choices concerning your sashiko skill level, taste, the time you want to spend on the project and what kind of sashiko you prefer.
When you've selected four different options, you will be transferred to a blog post that suggests a sashiko pattern you could stitch.

## Why the project is useful
There are so many different sashiko patterns. Especially when starting out, it is hard to judge which patterns are easy and which are hard to stitch, how long they will take to finish.
This app provides a playful way to navigate through the vast library of patterns.

## How users can get started with the project
Feel free to try out the app via the link above. Feel free to adjust it to your own needs for other hobbies.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
The project was created by me and will be adapted to feature more patterns in the future.

Any help making the code cleaner and faster is appreciated!
